Welcome! Iâ€™m a fourth-year Economics PhD candidate at Yale University. I use tools from Industrial Organization to study international labor topics. My projects use proprietary data from industry partners.

One strand of my research focuses on the design of online labor platforms. These platforms grew rapidly in the last two decades to match international workers and firms to work on service tasks. 

The other strand of my research is about more long-term employment relationships between international remote workers and their firms, including formal employer-employee relationships.
